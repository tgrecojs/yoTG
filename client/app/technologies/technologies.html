            <p class="tech-content">
                When building this application, I took advantage of UI-Router in correlation with generator-fullstack. As a result of this, I have the ability to easily integrate new content into my application, as well as remove it, thus making this application extremely scalable. Before using ui-router, I previously used ngRoute to route my single page applications; however, I found that ui-router offered capabilities far superior to ngRoute, specifically when dealing with nested states. Also, my contacts form was built using Angular's ngMessages API, which was released with Angular v1.3. I recently wrote a tutorial for SitePoint dealing with the ngMessage's API, as I feel it is important to stay on top with the latest features offered to developers.

                Throughout the course of my web development career, I have had the opportunity to teach people about different technologies used in web development. Throughout my time spent learning web development, I was constantly working to learn as much as possible in regards to web applications development, so I have been exposed to so much. That said, I have the ability to provide solid insight on a great deal of material. In the month of August, I will be publishing seventeen articles for Web Design Ledger. These articles will be published throughout the month, and range in topic from PhotoShop tutorials, to overviews of APIs, and JavaScript libraries.

            <p class="tech-content">
                When building out this application, I needed to implement a way of users to conact me. Therefore, I created a basic application form which I originally had wired to utilize FireBase's Backend-As-A-Service. Now, however, I have configured my contact form use a MongoDB's NoSql Database hosted on MongoLab. When dealing with MongoDB, I have worked to gain a great deal of knowledge of collections. In turn, I know possess the abilitly to build scalable RESTful APIs using non-relational databases. This web applications relies upon the mongoose ODM, which allows me to easily define custom schemas. That said, my time spent using Mongo has resulted in my ability to perform highly-detailed queries on the database, so that I can view specific information depeneding upon the parameters of a search.

                Whether I am using hot-keys in Adobe Illustrator, or using Sublime text plug-ins, I am always looking to speed up my development process. Therefore, I began to integrate GruntJS into my work-flow so that I could take care of all my tasks at once. Initially, I turned to Grunt to handle my .scss files, and reload them live in the browser after having trouble with Compass as a Ruby Gem. Now, as I continue to utilize Grunt each day. I even published an article, <a class="italics" href="http://bit.ly/gruntjs-sp">"5 Minutes to Min-Safe Angular Code"</a> with Grunt" on using Grunt In addition to using Grunt, I have experience in using GulpJS, however, I decided to stick with learning Grunt instead as I felt as though it was used more widely throughout the development community.

                Optimizing your web page is an essential practice that can not be overlooked. As a JavaScript developer, I build applications on top of the blazing fast Node engine. Additionally, I have a great deal of experience in working with SEO, and I possess the ability to implement the programming needed to optimize your page-rank. Additionally, I utilize services like prerender.io to help your page rise through Google, and other search engines. I can also get you up and running with a blog so that you can easily produce content, and further your raise in search rankings.
