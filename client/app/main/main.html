                Hello, and welcome to my web application! I am a graphic designer turned web engineer living in New York City. Currently, I am working on a few small projects, however I mainly work as a technical writer for a few different companies. My main area of focus deals with the building web applications using both client and server-side JavaScript, and so I teach people different stuff about these technologies.
                <br>
                <br> This application was custom built by myself using generator-fullstack. I am an avid Angular user, however you can read more about that in my applications <a ui-sref="technologies">technologies state</a>, you can check out some of the different . In addition to programming tomgreco.me, I also created the logo placed in the header using illustrator. As I mentioned above, I worked in graphic design before becoming passionate about the web. This had a tremendous impact on me, and the way I approach my learning. Now, I continue to place a high value on design, as I believe it is crucial to deliver the best user experience possible.
                <br>
